1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel very good about those! Those feel easy to me.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Over an hour, under two. I wasn't keeping track unfortunately. I thought it would take much longer honestly!
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?'
I need to practice the harder stuff, like logical operators.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I think I will review my notes after this week and practice a few hours a day until I feel fluent in it.
